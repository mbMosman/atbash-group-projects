## Minneapolis Public Schools

Client(s): Eliana Power

Application to assist with scheduling community education classes. It's currently a very labor intensive process managed through a Google Forms, an excel spreadsheet and a lot of email/phone conversations. Need to coordinate classes, instructors, and the times for particular spaces. 

May be helpful to import/export data from spreadsheet (CSV file).

## HighTech Kids

Client(s): Cheryl Moeller & Jeannie Badger
Website: https://hightechkids.org/

High Tech Kids is a nonprofit supporting teams involved in the Firs Lego League tournaments. They support more than 50,000 students across the state, with the help of over 2000 volunteers. They are looking for an application to help teams track scoring as they prepare for the for annual competition. 

Each year's competition has different goals for scoring. They already have an application that generates those rules as XML, which this application could read in to create an online score card. There would be multiple roles for this application:

- admin - create/upload the rules for the year
- coach - add new score results for their team, view history of scores, setup team/student access (?)
- students (?) - 1 login per team, view only of results for their team

Mobile first, ideally would support both mobile/tablet. 

## UMN Good Agricultural Practices (GAP)

Client: Cindy Tong

Farmers are required by the FDA to keep certain records about their business and production. These records are critical when food safety events happen. This record keeping can be difficult for farmers working in field and farm environments. The goal of this project is to develop an application to assist with this record keeping. 

This was previously explored by the Cypress UX cohort, with a series of wireframes produced for a potential application. There are some mock-ups from this that may be helpful when talking with the client, but do not assume that they must represent the application to develop. The scope will be smaller, and the mockup flow and layout may change as you develop your own scope and wireframes.

Application roles:

- Farmer - setup for year, enter data, view history (stretch add/manage workers)
- Worker - __stretch__ access setup by farmer to help with data entry and perform certain tasks

This application should be designed mobile first for data entry, but will potentially also want a desktop view to better support reports and history.


## Immigrant Families Together

Client(s): Stephanie Diehl, Jamie Swezey, Julie Schwietert Collazo
Website: https://immigrantfamiliestogether.com/

They are a rapid response group of volunteers who galvanized around the crises provoked by the zero tolerance policy. We raise money to bond out parents and reunite them with their families, and we provide ongoing support -legal, medical, housing, clothing food. and more-to these families as they proceed thorough their legal cases. They provide bonds, living expenses, funds for medical & legal expenses, & other support to reunite immigrant families who've been separated. Often these are parents and children who have been separated, but a recent case reunited two brothers.

An application is needed to help with case management and volunteer coordination. There will be two different roles:

- organizer/admin with full access to information and ability to add new cases/families
- volunteer access to only assigned cases

This application should be designed mobile first.
